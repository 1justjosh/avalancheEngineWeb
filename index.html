            <p class="left-txt">This game framework, built using Java and LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library), provides a robust foundation for developing both 2D and 3D games. Leveraging LWJGL's powerful features, the framework supports advanced graphics rendering through OpenGL, allowing developers to create visually stunning environments with intricate textures, lighting effects, and smooth animations. The framework is designed with flexibility in mind, enabling developers to easily switch between 2D and 3D modes, catering to various game styles from platformers to immersive 3D adventures.</p>
